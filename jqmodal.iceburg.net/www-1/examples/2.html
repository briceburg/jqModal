I am content loaded from "examples/2.html" through an AJAX request.
<hr />

A "closing link" should be provided in this response, since the response text
fills (overwrites) the entire window, and thus any closing links it may have
contained. To avoid this, ajax content can be "targeted" within a preconstructed
window -- demonstrated in example 3b.
<br /><br />
By default, "close triggers" (which hide the window) are assigned to element(s) 
with class <i>jqmClose</i>. If you want to use a different class name, pass the 
<i>closeClass</i> parameter. See the <a href="README">documentation</a> for instructions.

<br /><br />
Lets provide some <em>Close Triggers</em>;
<br/>To <b>CLOSE THIS WINDOW</b>..
<a href="#" class="jqmClose">Click me</a> ... or 
<button class="xxx jqmClose">me</button> ... or 
<div class="yyy zzz jqmClose" style="display: inline; background-color:blue;color:white;padding:4px;">even me</div>.

<p>
To view the contents of this ajax request, click <a href="examples/2.html">here</a>. 
Notice how the close links were setup.
