  USAGE
=========

  1.
  jqModal attaches itself to an element, turning that element into a dialog. e.g.
    $(e).jqm();
    
  The $.jqm(); function takes parameters. Parameters and their defaults are listed
  below. As example, you can disalbe the display of an overlay and pull the dialog content
  from a remote source (ajax url) via;
  
  	$(e).jqm({ajax:'menu/welcome.html',overlay:0});
  
  Usually the element (e) is hidden from view via CSS (display: none), and shown
  when a "trigger" is clicked. The dialog is closed when a "close" is clicked. 
  You can manually show or hide a dialog with $.jqmShow() and $.jqmHide(). e.g.
  
    $(e).jqm().jqmShow(); $('#window2').jqmHide();
    
      will show the dialog attached to (e), and hide the dialog attached to the
      element with an ID of window2, without any "trigger" being clicked.
      
  2.
  Triggers and Closes are typically added on the fly via CSS class selections when $.jqm() 
  is called on element(s). They can also be manually added. e.g.
  
    $(e).jqmAddTrigger(triggers) will add a "trigger" to open (show) dialog(s) attached to e, and
    $(e).jqmAddClose(closes) will add a "close" to close (hide) the dialog(s) attached to e.
    
  From the wording above, it should be gathered that you can assign, show, hide,
  and add closes/triggers to multiple dialogs at once! Further, triggers and closes can
  be assosiated with multiple dialogs, and can show AND hide dialogs. e.g. 
  
   1 $('#a,#b,#c').jqm();
   2 $('#a,#b').jqmShow().jqmAddClose(trigger);
   3 $('#c').jqmAddTrigger(trigger);
  	
  	1: assign dialogs to elements with ID a, b, and c
  	2: open a and b, assign a "close" to 'trigger' for both a and b dialogs.
  	3: assign a "open" to 'trigger' for c dialog.
  	
  	clicking 'trigger' will close a and b dialogs, and open c dialog.
  	

======================
  $.jqm() PARAMETERS
======================
  
1. [ GENERAL ]
***************

modal (bool)
-------------
  If modal is enabled (true), input (mouse clicks, keypresses) will be locked to the
  modal window (forced focus a.k.a. "true modal"). If false, the user will be able to
  interact outside of the modal window. 
  
  If false and overlay is enabled, CLICKING THE OVERLAY WILL CLOSE THE DIALOG.
  
  default: FALSE


overlay (int)
---------------
  The overlay transparency as a percentage. If 0 the overlay is disabled, and
  the page will remain interactive. If 100 the overlay will be 100% opaque.
	  
  default: 50
  

trigger (mixed)
---------------
  When a trigger is clicked, the window it is assosiated with is displayed. jqModal
  will by default look through the entire DOM for elements matching class "jqModal"
  and assign a "open" trigger to those found.
  
  The trigger can be;
    (str) - a jQuery Selector (CSS/XPATH) see; http://docs.jquery.com/DOM/Traversing/Selectors
    (object) - a DOM element (e.g. trigger =  document.getElementById("trigger"); )
    (false) - if FALSE, no trigger will be looked up.
    
  default: '.jqModal' (css selector, "elements with class jqModal")
  

closeClass (str|false)
----------------
  jqModal will by default look through the window for elements matching class "jqmClose",
  and assign a "close" trigger to those found. When a close trigger is clicked, the dialog
  is hidden.
  
  If false, no "close" triggers will be assigned/looked for.
    
  default: 'jqmClose'
  

2. [ STYLING ]
****************
  
overlayClass (str)
--------------------
  Name of CSS class applied to the Overlay (defines tint color, background image, etc.).
  
  default: 'jqmOverlay'

  
zIndex (int)
---------------	
  The default z-index value for a dialog. If one is defined via CSS, the CSS
  z-index will take priority (and the parameter value ignored).
	
  default: 3000

  
3. [ AJAX RELATED ]
*********************

ajax (str)
---------------
  If ajax is passed, the content of the window will be pulled remotely via an AJAX
  request.
  
  A URL (str) is accepted, the windows content will be loaded from this URL
    (e.g. {ajax: 'include/dialog.html' })
  
  The URL can also be extracted from an attribute of the triggering element
  by prefixing with a '@'. For instance, {ajax: '@href' } would tell jqModal to 
  extract the remote content URL from the triggering link's [<a href="blah.html">] 
  HREF attribute. Any attribute can be used.
    (e.g. $(e).jqm({ajax:'@name'}); }
  
  NOTE; To use custom ajax routines, utilize an "on open" callback function. If you
    need to process the ajax return, see the "onLoad" callback.
    
  default: FALSE
  

target (mixed)
---------------
  The ajax target allows you to set the target element for an ajax request to load content
  into. This is useful if you'd like to retain the styling and markup of a preconstructed
  window.
  
  NOTE; target is applicable only if the ajax parameter is passed. The target MUST EXIST
  within the passed window element.
  
  EXAMPLE;
  (markup)
  <div id="window">
	  <div class="header">..</div>
	  <div class="target">[LOAD CONTENT HERE]</div>
	  <div class="footer">..</div>
  </div>
  
  (script)
  $().ready(function() { 
    $('#window').jqm({ajax: 'include/dialog.html', target: '.target'});
  });
  
  OR
  
  (script)
  $().ready(function() { 
    var target = $('#window div.target')[0];
    $('#window').jqm({ajax: 'include/dialog.html', target: target});
  });
	  
  default: Assignment Element (e.g. In example above, this would be <div id="window">)
  

4. [ CALLBACKS ]
******************

  Callbacks functions allow complete customization and control. There are three callback
  functions; "onShow", "onHide", and "onLoad".
  	
  Each callback is passed the jqModal "hash" for a window. Relevant hash properties are;
  
  	-----------------------------------
  	w: (jQuery object) The window element. e.g. '#example' in the sample above
  	c: (object) The config object (holds passed+default parameters)
  	o: (jQuery object) The overlay
  	t: (DOM object) The triggering element
  	
  NOTE; If you supply a "onHide" callback, you MUST execute hash.o.remove(); to
    remove the overlay. You should also hide the window via hash.w.hide();, or
    with a special effect.
    
  NOTE; If you supply a "onShow" callback, you should make the dialog visible
    via hash.w.show();, or with a special effect.
    
  NOTE; "onLoad" callbacks are ONLY executed if the ajax parameter was passed.
    onLoad is called after the ajax response. As with $.load(), the "this" 
    scope is a reference to the ajax target as a DOM element.
    
    
    Example use of callbacks;
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
    
    // [[[ setup callbacks ]]]
    
    // onLoad : assign ajaxForm to the returned form element
      var load=function(hash){ $('form',this).ajaxForm(); };
      
    // onShow : show+make the window translucent
      var open=function(hash){ hash.w.css('opacity',0.88).show(); };
      
    // onHide : fade the window out, kill overlay after fade.
      var close=function(hash) { hash.w.fadeOut('2000',function(){ hash.o.remove(); }); };
      
    // [[[ setup dialog w/ callbacks ]]]
      
      $('.dialog').jqm({
      	onLoad: load,
      	onShow: open,
      	onHide: close});
      	
    </script>
